# Tetris

This application is a game called **Tetris**. 
To be blunt, it will allow the user to play Tetris, save their current state of the game, and load a save file back. 
It is a single player game, and it is made for anyone who wants to play and try it out. 

If you haven't heard about **Tetris** before, then the goal of the game is to reach the highest score by clearing as 
many *rows* as possible. To make these *rows*, you would need to create a row by using
*blocks* which make up the **Tetris** pieces also known as **Tetrominos**. These pieces fall at a certain speed
which slowly increases as the game goes on. Be careful not to reach the top of the board or the game ends.
Reach the highest score you can!
